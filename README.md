# osu!XR
Rhythmic immersion on another level.

osu!XR is a VR port of osu!lazer.

If you would like to receive notifications when a new o!xr release is published and/or join the discussion about it, [join our osu ruleset discord server](discord.gg/QGqD3eBx7b) and ask for an osu-xr role at #osu-xr which is pinged when a new release is published.

If you wish to support the development of o!xr, you can support me at https://ko-fi.com/perigee <3
# Features
osu!XR allows you to play all the official and custom rulesets osu!lazer does.

You can play with one or two pointers on a big screen or use your hands to control osu with a touchscreen.

Don't limit yourself to one screen resolution - you can adjust that in XR settings.

# Bindings
Default controller bindings exist for:
* Valve Index
* Oculus Quest 2
* HTC Vive

If you use a different controller and made good bindings, make sure you contribute them to the project!

# ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
oxr is currently not in best shape. There are bugs, naming inconsistencies and awkward limitations. This codebase will undergo an overhaul, which means na major updates for a while.

The project is also currently linked to local copies of osu!lazer (as its needed to embed the 4 standard game modes) and o!f-xr (because I didn't make a nuget yet). If you wish to contribute, you will need to clone them too for the time being.
