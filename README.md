# osu!XR
Rhythmic immersion on another level.

osu!XR is a VR port of osu!lazer.
# Features
osu!XR allows you to play all the official and custom rulesets osu!lazer does.

You can play with one or two pointers on a big screen or use your hands to control osu with a touchscreen.

Don't limit yourself to one screen resolution - you can adjust that in XR settings.

# Bindings
Default controller bindings exist for:
* Valve Index

If you use a different controller and made good bindings, make sure you contribute them to the project!

# TODO
* Add a virtual keyboard - vivecraft style.
* Add trigger zones - volumes of space that activate a binding then you touch them.
* Add ability to import models so you can play games on arcade machines and decorate your enviornment.
* Make an interface for osu rulesets so they can define the default way they should be played in VR.
* Fix a bug where sometimes on startup osu crashes.
