[2021.08.26]

## User Experience
Inspector selections now have an animation.
Made all panels the same size and look.
The handheld menu now only shows the top panel and transitions between with a "popout" animation.
Panels now have tooltips.
Updated the look of this changelog!
Other minor UX changes.
Model loading ( such as controllers ) is now done in the background which reduces load-lag.

## Bugfixes
Fixed a bug where some drawables would render twice (the issue was that they would get loaded before being added to the 3d hierarchy and anything that worked on the hierarchy in the load method would cause this).
Notification panel now doesnt open on startup.
Keyboard is now focused correctly.
Fixed a bug where touch pointers would register collisions where there were none.

## Framework
Models' tint now is multiplied with alpha.
Added ability to fully parse OBJ and MTL files, however not all shader properties are supported.
Added ability to fully parse BLEND files and extract meshes, however no material information can be extracted yet.

## Debugging
The reflections inspector is now avaiable only in debug builds.


[2021.06.03]
## New Features
Implemented saving and loading ruleset bindings.
Ruleset bindings now support rulesets with variants like osu!mania.
Added this changelog!

## User Expreience
Improved transparency rendering. The keyboard will no longer have jank visuals when pressing a key and the pointers will not make panels see-through.
The default preset has a better screen size now.
The inspector panel got a fleshed out look and functionality:
A new hierarchy inspector.
A new reflections inspector: you can edit: int, float, double, string, enum, color4, vector2, vector3 and bindables of these types.
Custom sections for elements with settings
The keyboard now flashes the pressed key.

## Bugfixes
The inspector selection box now correctly selects objects with an offset.
Fixed collisions not working on flat Y-planes. There is a floor collider now!

## Framework
Improved physics performance.

## Debugging
You can now inspect 2D drawables.
There is also a secondary selection box for previewed elements.


[2021.05.19]
## New features
Added ruleset bindings:
Clap - based on how close your primary and secondary controllers are
Buttons - primary and secondary buttons on each controller
Joystick:
	Zone - an arc with a deadzone
	Movement - you can move the cursor with the joystick

## User Expreience
When in 2 pointer mode and one hand is occupied (for example, holding a menu), the other pointer will act as if it was in 1 pointer mode.
The menu now sticks to your offhand even in 1 pointer mode, as long as you have a secondary controller.
