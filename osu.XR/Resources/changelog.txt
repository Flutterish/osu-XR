The inspector selection box now correctly selects objects with an offset.
When you hover over a button in the inspector hiererchy, a seconday yellow selection box shows that object.
Improved transparency rendering. The keyboard will no longer have jank visuals when pressing a key and the pointers will not make panels see-through.

Improved physics performance.


[2021.05.19]
When in 2 pointer mode and one hand is occupied (for example, holding a menu), the other pointer will act as if it was in 1 pointer mode.
The menu now sticks to your offhand even in 1 pointer mode, as long as you have a secondary controller.
Added ruleset bindings:
* Clap - based on how close your primary and secondary controllers are
* Buttons - primary and secondary buttons on each controller
* Joystick:
	* Zone - an arc with a deadzone
	* Movement - you can move the cursor with the joystick
